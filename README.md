Do NBA Referees Swallow Their Whistles in Crunch Time?

Are fewer fouls called in the final 2 minutes of a close game compared to the rest of the game?
Are fewer shooting fouls called late in close games?
Do different types of fouls (personal, offensive, technical) change in frequency near the end?

Another interesting question that could be answered with the data I collect to answer the above questions is: Assess whether foul calls changed in the absence of crowd pressure (during the 2019-2020 bubble championship -> could split data from the season pre-buble and post-bubble)

Does home team or visitor team commit less fould?

Compare foul rates:

    Last 2 minutes of 4th quarter in close games (score margin ≤ 5).

    Rest of regulation time.

Compute fouls per minute in both periods.

Does the losing team commit more fouls?
How do foul rates differ in the last 2 mins of Q4 vs the rest of the game?

How many of these were "close games" (SCOREMARGIN ≤ 5)?

    Close games vs blowouts

    Foul type: e.g., flagrant vs personal

    PERIOD: early vs late game
